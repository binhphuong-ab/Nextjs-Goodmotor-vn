# Droplet Digital Ocean SSH Key Authentication Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the SSH key authentication setup for secure, password-free access to your Digital Ocean Droplet VPS.

## ‚úÖ Current Status
- **SSH Key Type**: Ed25519 (modern, secure)
- **Digital Ocean Droplet**: ‚úÖ Configured and secured
- **Password Authentication**: ‚ùå Disabled (more secure)
- **Setup Date**: August 25, 2025

## üîë How SSH Key Authentication Works

SSH key authentication uses a pair of cryptographic keys:
- **Private Key**: Stays on your local machine (never share this!)
- **Public Key**: Copied to the server you want to access

When you connect, the server uses your public key to verify your private key without transmitting passwords.

## üìã Setup Steps Completed

### 1. Key Generation
Your SSH keys were already generated:
```bash
# Ed25519 keys (recommended)
~/.ssh/id_ed25519     # Private key
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # Public key

# RSA keys (legacy, also available)
~/.ssh/id_rsa         # Private key
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub     # Public key
```

### 2. Public Key Installation
Your Ed25519 public key was copied to the VPS:
```bash
# Public key content:
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJf5y906pdbfrQh2qR+U5/oxXA/a77khSeYTvwzt4z+J 2015phuong@gmail.com
```

### 3. VPS Configuration
- Created `~/.ssh/` directory with proper permissions (700)
- Added public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (600 permissions)
- Disabled password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
- Backed up original SSH configuration to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup`

## üöÄ How to Connect

### Simple Connection (recommended)
```bash
ssh root@134.209.99.219
```
No password required! The system automatically uses your SSH key.

### Explicit Key Specification
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@134.209.99.219
```

### Force Key Authentication Only
```bash
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey -o PasswordAuthentication=no root@134.209.99.219
```

## üîí Security Benefits

1. **No Password Transmission**: Keys are never sent over the network
2. **Brute Force Protection**: Impossible to guess SSH keys
3. **Convenience**: No need to remember/type passwords
4. **Audit Trail**: Key-based access can be logged and tracked
5. **Revocable**: Public keys can be removed without changing passwords

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection with verbose output
ssh -v root@134.209.99.219

# Check if key is loaded in SSH agent
ssh-add -l

# Add key to SSH agent if needed
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix local permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Fix remote permissions (if needed)
ssh root@134.209.99.219 "chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

## üìù Server Information

### Digital Ocean Droplet VPS
- **IP**: 134.209.99.219
- **Hostname**: debian-s-1vcpu-2gb-70gb-intel-sgp1-01
- **OS**: Debian 6.1.0-26-amd64
- **Location**: Singapore (sgp1)
- **SSH Key Authentication**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Password Authentication**: ‚ùå Disabled

## üéØ Next Steps for Additional Security

### 1. Set up SSH Key for First VPS
Apply the same setup to your main VPS mentioned in `VPS_CONNECTION_INFO.md`

### 2. Create SSH Config File
Create `~/.ssh/config` for easier management:
```bash
# Digital Ocean Droplet VPS
Host droplet-do
    HostName 134.209.99.219
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# Then connect with: ssh droplet-do
```

### 3. Additional Hardening Options
- Change SSH port from 22 to non-standard port
- Enable fail2ban for intrusion prevention
- Set up firewall (ufw) rules
- Create non-root user with sudo privileges

## üîß Backup and Recovery

### Backup Your Keys
```bash
# Create secure backup of your private keys
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/secure-backup-location/
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ~/secure-backup-location/

# Or create encrypted archive
tar czf ssh-keys-backup.tar.gz ~/.ssh/
gpg --symmetric ssh-keys-backup.tar.gz
```

### Emergency Access
If you lose your keys, you can still access via Digital Ocean console or recovery mode to:
1. Re-enable password authentication temporarily
2. Add new SSH keys
3. Re-disable password authentication
